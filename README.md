# blog_project
This project is a blog website built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It features user authentication using JWT tokens, allowing users to register, log in, and manage posts. The responsive design ensures usability across devices. Secure password handling and protected routes are implemented on the backend.
